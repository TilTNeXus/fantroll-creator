# Xamag's Fantroll Creator

A remake of [Xamag's Fantroll Creator](https://xamag.itch.io/fantroll-creator) with SDL3 and OpenGL.
* Cross platform (Only tested Mac and WebAssembly so far)
* Mouse controls
* Mobile support

## Build Instructions
* Install SDL3
* I don't remember how exactly I made OpenGL work, but I'll change this later
* run `make <platform>` with platform being `mac`, `wasm`, something else

All art assets by Xamag.
